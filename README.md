# Task Management App - Backend

This repository contains the backend code for the Task Management App. It is built with Node.js and Express.js, providing RESTful APIs for task management.

## Features

### ðŸ”¹ Signup

The backend allows users to create a new account by providing their name, email, and password. The API will handle user registration and store the data securely.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Login

Users can log into the system with their email and password. The backend authenticates the credentials and returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) for session management.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Dashboard

The dashboard API fetches the list of all tasks assigned to the logged-in user. The user can view the tasks, their statuses, and other related information.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Create New Task

A form where the user can create a new task. The backend API allows users to input task details like the title, description, and priority level.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Edit Task

The user can edit a task's details such as title, description, or due date. The API updates the task information in the database.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Delete Task

Users can delete tasks. The backend API provides an endpoint to delete a task from the database based on its ID.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for server-side code.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: Database to store user and task information.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and authorization.
- **Mongoose**: ORM for MongoDB, to interact with the database.
